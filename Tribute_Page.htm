          <li><a href="http://bit.ly/2qemPqS" id="tribute-link" target="_blank">Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche</a> (/ˈniːtʃə, ˈniːtʃi/,[11][12] German: [ˈfʁiːdʁɪç ˈvɪlhɛlm ˈniːtʃə] (About this soundlisten) or [- ˈniːtsʃə];[13][14][15] 15 October 1844 – 25 August 1900) was a German philosopher, cultural critic, composer, poet, philologist, and Latin and Greek scholar whose work has exerted a profound influence on modern intellectual history.[16][17][18][19][20] He began his career as a classical philologist before turning to philosophy.</li>
          <li>He became the youngest ever to hold the Chair of Classical Philology at the University of Basel in 1869 at the age of 24.</li>
          <li>Nietzsche resigned in 1879 due to health problems that plagued him most of his life; he completed much of his core writing in the following decade.</li>
          <li>In 1889, at age 44, he suffered a collapse and afterward a complete loss of his mental faculties.</li>
          <li>He lived his remaining years in the care of his mother until her death in 1897 and then with his sister Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche.</li>
